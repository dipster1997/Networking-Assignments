# Networking Project
This project got me involved with understadning Network Architecture and Protocols and using problem solving skills to set up the following 3:-

1. A simple web server that is able to setup a simple static web page
2. 1-way chat that sends messages and transmits files over the UDP protocol on top of an unreliable channel that may either corrupt or drop packets randomly
3. Establishing a cryptographic and secure channel of communication between Alice and Bob
